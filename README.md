# MultiTypeChess
A general-purpose **standard** chess library that can be extendable. Yes, literally, it supports the Polyglot standard at http://hgm.nubati.net/book_format.html and it can be made to create Polyglot opening books.

**Caution**: This is a C++23 library. Also it uses tons of compile time, so put the constexpr steps limit to 2 billion to make it compiles.
